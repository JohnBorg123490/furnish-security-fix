# Furnish Changelog

## Furnish versioning

- Each release of Furnish is only compatible with one version of Minecraft.
- There will be no backport of any feature in an earlier Minecraft version.
- This goes for bug fixes too. Bug fixes are only available in the next version of Furnish.

This set of rules is the only way I can work on Furnish efficiently on my limited time, thanks for your understanding!
